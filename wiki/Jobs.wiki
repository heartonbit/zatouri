#summary Keep looking. Don't settle.

당신의 직업은 당신 인생의 많은 부분을 차지하게 될 것이다. 그리고 그 일을 함에 있어 진정 만족하려면, 당신이 굉장하다고 믿을 수 있는 일을 하는 방법 밖엔 없다. 그 일을 아직 찾지 못했다면, 계속 찾아야한다. 주저앉지마라. 

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.

-Steve Jobs
