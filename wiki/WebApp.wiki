#summary A Thorough Research about Web and App

=Web? App?=

==Web은 뭐고, App은 무엇인고?==

==각각의 장단점==

  Sencha Touch is an application framework (you create your interface programmatically through Javascript) while jQuery Mobile is more of a mobile enhancement library (you write regular HTML for your content, then add jQuery mobile for transitions/animations). jQuery Mobile has an easier learning curve, but Sencha Touch can better simulate "native" apps.
