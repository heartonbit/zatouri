=MSSQL에서 인덱스를 만들때 INCLUDE 구문을 쓰는 이유=


 If the column is not in the WHERE/JOIN/GROUP BY/ORDER BY, but only in the column list in the SELECT clause.

 The INCLUDE clause adds the data at the lowest/leaf level, rather than in the index tree. This makes the index smaller because it's not part of the tree

 This means it isn't really useful for predicates, sorting etc as I mentioned above. However, it may be useful if you have a residual lookup in a few rows from the key column(s)
